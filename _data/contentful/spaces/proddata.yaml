  theInitiativeText: "__Camp Adventure: __\nWe need some adventure leaders to plan
    camp excursions or adventure. \n\nAdventures should be interactive, mystical,
    include everybody, and go on for a hours. Or you know, a BBQ in Deep Playa is
    totally acceptable too \U0001F609  Last year, Brian and Nate organized an engaging
    final ceremony complete with a live action story played out by camp members. \n\n__Workshops:__\nWorkshops
    are open for anyone to attend. In the past, Camp Let it Go has offered workshops
    on capoeira, yoga and meditation. We need your help with setting up some fun,
    interesting and meaningful workshops for camp this year.  Use your talents to
    teach a skill or lead an important discussion. Any suggestions are welcome.  \n\nWorkshops
    will be scheduled in advance and listed on the Let it Go schedule.  \n\nStarting
    in June, we can submit our workshop schedule to the Burning Man organizers to
    be listed in the What Where When booklet.  The booklets are distributed to each
    attendee so this is a great way to advertise the Let it Go contribution. \n\n__Camp
    Duties:__ Members volunteer for camp duties to help camp run efficiently.  Duties
    include ice runs, cooking and cleaning, decorating etc. Members can sign up for
    camp duties on the master Let it Go spreadsheet.  Everyone is expected to participate
    in camp duties!\n\n\nTHE BAR\n__For people new to Burning Man__: Burning man has
    little if no services provided by the festival. The people that come are the ones
    who put together the music, the stages, the art, the bars, and the food/gifts.
    The city is made by you!\n\nThe bar is one of the ways our camp gives back to
    black rock city. (The city that is burning man). We ask that you work some shifts.
    If you don’t know how to make drinks, all good! Here’s your chance to learn! Also
    If you don’t have a scheduled shift you can always jump back there to help! It’s
    a great way to make people happy, meet people, and hear their crazy burning man
    stories! All you gotta say, is how was your day!\n\n Bar duties\n- Have a drink,
    you’re a fucking bartender.\n- We have a wheel that people spin to see what they
    need to do for a drink \U0001F609\n- Check IDs\n- If your shift is 2-5 get Ice
    before your shift \U0001F642\n- Empty trash and replace bag at beginning of shift
    if it’s full.\n- Dump half empty beers/drinks in a bucket, do not throw away cups
    only beer cans/bottles.\n- End of shift, clean off the bar for the next person
    replace full trash if full. (Some redundancy here in case)\n- Last shift people-
    if no one else is there, close down the bar. \n\nIce Run\nIn the past we were
    doing ice runs twice a day. Some days we spent close to $60-70 a day on ice. I
    am wondering if we could potentially switch to a chest freezer running of solar.\n[Link

  bio: "Funky Flow is a French music producer and DJ born in Biarritz, a beach town
    where surf, sand, and dirty dancing abound. He is a passionate artist surfing
    the tech-funk genre. He shows dynamic range and isn't afraid to bend genres, dabbling
    in slow acid techno, electro swing, and tech house. Funkenstein started mixing
    in San Francisco, where the electronic music scene has reached a fever pitch.
    From 2009-2010, he had a residency in two clubs in Oxford, England. He has since
    played a series of private events in and around Paris, including the annual Burning
    Night at the Moulin Rouge in 2013. \n\nFunky Flow is particularly fond of beats
    that have a very dark and groovy bassline, snares that 'snap' and spooky atmospheres.\n\nHe
    is helping building the website as well as leading some martial arts workshops
    (Capoeira) at the camp."

    our most intimate emotions, thoughts, and self.  A space where you need not fear
    being judged and you can be your true self, or explore all the possibilities of
    who you can be. A space where you can connect and explore territories of love
    and trust where everyone gives and receives to help bridge the gap between you
    and I.  __A space to learn.  A space to teach.  A space to let. it. go.__\n \nOur
    reason for existence/purpose is ultimately to encourage people to let go of the
    conceptual mind that seems to know who we are and what's reality, the ego.  It’s
    the voice in your head that's pretending to be us, but it’s mainly concerned on
    survival, it prevents us from being present in each moment.  It prevents us from
    being at ease in our lives and from reaching our most innate dreams and visions.
    \ Thoughts of past and future, self-doubt, self-pity, and paranoia are all manifestations
    of the ego that are keeping you from being present in the universe, the state
    of being that your soul is longing for.  It's absolutely vital to human health
    to have access to the inner stillness.  When everyone acts from a place of oneness,
    of egolessness, there will be no more warfare, racism, division, and greed.  Ultimately,
    we want to create a better, happier and more peaceful world. Right here, right
    now, is the only place there is and ever will be and the only place where we can
    truly be ourselves.\n \nWe wish to help direct people towards a place within that
    is of love and peace, a place that is pure.  There are different possibilities
    for people to let go of their minds, their bodies, their limiting beliefs and
    most importantly the suffering that is essentially not 'your' suffering.  Routes
    of exploration could be through yoga, meditation, psychedelic journeys, expressive
    dance, intuitive painting and much more.\n \nWe imagine Burning Man to be the
    perfect environment for profound personal transformations and consciousness expanding
    experiences.  __Welcome to our burning man family from the bottom of our hearts!__"
